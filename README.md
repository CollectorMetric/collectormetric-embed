collectormetric-embed
=====================

embed objects stored in your CollectorMetric account into blogs, forum posts, or any HTML/JS  webpage.

## Usage

Anywhere on your website or blog, include the script tags below to load in our code that makes the embeddable widgets.  This script needs to be only loaded once in your site either between the `<head>` tags or within the body of a post.

```
<script src="http://collectormetric.github.io/collectormetric-embed/collectormetric-embed.js"></script>
```

Anywhere that you want to display an item, use the HTML code below and your widget with the CM item will be loaded.  Replace the example username with your own and supply an id for your item which can be found on the "Share" tab of your CM item.  All necessary code can also be generated from within the "Share" tab.

```
<div data-collectormetric-username="marklinstop" data-collectormetric-id="preiser-lumber-b1bfb6d3-a725-4b08-ad78-7798300da6b4"></div>
```
